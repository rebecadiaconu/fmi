  The Cocke–Younger–Kasami-Algorithm (CYK or CKY) is a highly efficient parsing algorithm for 
context-free grammars. This makes it ideal to decide the word-problem for context-free grammars, given in Chomsky 
normal form (CNF). The following tool can be used to check if a certain word w∈Σ* is part of a language, given in
CNF grammar.
